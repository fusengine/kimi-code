description: Use when starting any design task — resolves register, sets the 3 dials, locks Gate 0, and routes to the right move and target skill.

<objective>
The core design method and entry point for any design task: resolves the Register (brand vs product), states the Design Read one-liner and sets the 3 numeric dials (DESIGN_VARIANCE, VISUAL_DENSITY, MOTION_INTENSITY) against a scale anchored on the ten reference pages, enforces the Gate 0 brief lock before any HTML/CSS/tokens are touched, applies the Absolute bans, runs the 2-level AI-slop test, and routes to the matching move (generate, critique, audit, bolder, quieter, distill, harden, polish, redesign) and its target skill.

Read this first — before `design-system`, any `register/*.md` file, or any `moves/*.md` file. This skill owns the gate and the routing table, not the move procedures themselves.
</objective>

<!-- Grounding: grounding-corpus.md §A (impeccable anatomy — thin router, Register, dials, Absolute bans, 2-level slop test), §G (root-cause fix: template reproduction demoted, register-first), §H (kept anchors: Gate 0, Signature Dominance, Focal-Block Floor, Competitor Lift Test, MOTION_INTENSITY). -->

# Design Method — The Core

This is the one place the design pipeline is defined. The agent (`agents/design-expert.md`)
always loads this file before dispatching to a move; every `references/register/*.md` and
`references/moves/*.md` file assumes you've read this first and references it instead of
restating it — if a rule elsewhere contradicts this file, this file wins.

## Setup

How this core gets loaded, every time, no exceptions:

1. Read this file once per task — not once per move. Skip the re-read for a later move in
   the same task if neither the Register nor the codebase changed.
2. **Read `../design-system/SKILL.md`** — always, unconditionally, before anything else
   below. Thin pointer file, cheap to reload, and the harness's phase-1 trigger, so it runs
   even on a task needing no new token. Existing `design-system.md` tokens still win over
   its defaults once resolved.
3. Resolve **Register** (below), then write the **Design Read + 3 dials** one-liner.
4. Pass **Gate 0 — Brief Lock** (below) before touching any HTML/CSS/tokens.
5. Read the ONE matched `references/moves/<move>.md` from the Routing table — not two, not
   a skim of several to "compare." The move file owns the how; this file owns the gate and
   the pointer.
6. If the move builds or touches code, read the matching
   `references/register/{brand,product}.md` floors too, once.

## Register

Resolve **before anything else downstream** — brand vs product gates every floor (Signature
Dominance, Focal-Block Floor, tone bounds, motion budget, dial presets). Never default
silently.

- **brand** — one dominant, expressive message: marketing site, launch page, identity.
- **product** — dense, predictable, motion stays discreet: dashboard, SaaS tool, utility
  screen.

**Priority order (fixed, first match wins):**
1. The owner states it explicitly.
2. An existing `design-system.md`/`PRODUCT.md` already classifies it.
3. Inferable from the concrete surface (dashboard/settings/internal tool → `product`;
   landing/marketing/campaign/identity → `brand`).
4. Still unclear → ask **ONE** question. Never guess past this point.

Once resolved, load `references/register/brand.md` or `references/register/product.md` —
each carries the floors, tone bounds and motion budget for that lane. For copy/microcopy
tone, load `references/register/copy.md` (any move touching user-facing text, plus
`ux-copy`).

## Design Read + the 3 dials

Before any palette/font/layout choice, state one line:

```
Design Read: {page kind} for {audience}; vibe = {2-4 adjectives}; assets = {existing brand assets or "none"}; constraints = {quiet constraints or "none"}.
```

Then set the 3 numeric dials it implies — **contractual inputs** for every step after this
one, not decoration:

| Dial | 1 | 10 |
|------|---|----|
| `DESIGN_VARIANCE` | rigid, symmetrical, conventional | highly art-directed, asymmetric |
| `VISUAL_DENSITY` | airy, gallery-like, calm | packed, information-dense |
| `MOTION_INTENSITY` | static / near-still | cinematic, scroll-driven |

Preset-by-use-case table, partial-brief fallbacks and `MOTION_INTENSITY` bands (calm <4 /
expressive 4–7 / cinematic >7) live in `../design-system/references/design-read-dials.md`
— don't restate them here. The brief always overrides any default; an unresolvable dial
uses the documented fallback and says so in the Design Read line, never a silent guess.

### What each number means — anchored on the corpus

Poles alone are unusable: nobody knows what a 7 looks like, so an unanchored dial drifts
to the middle and the middle is where every generated page already lives. The scales below
are anchored on the ten reference pages, each value read from that page's own
`design-system.md` under `../design-web/references/refs-design/` (short names below are those
directories). These are not scores. All ten pages were judged good; the numbers say what
kind of page it is, never how well it was done.

**`DESIGN_VARIANCE` — how far the composition departs from the canonical skeleton.**

| n | Page | What it looks like |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `fora-recode` | "Bookended Canon" — nav, hero, intro, features, what-you-get, pricing, footer, almost to the letter. Reads specific anyway: one device, a 1px rule at white 10%, is the only line in the system and carries every edge, card outline and divider. |
| 3 | `cursor-recode` | "Ramp and Newsroom" — deliberately unstyled page furniture; the art direction lives entirely in the floating product window, not in the layout. |
| 3 | `endlesstools-recode` | "Showreel Canon" — the canonical order, compressed, with every slot filled by footage instead of a card. |
| 4 | `harness-recode`, `linear-recode`, `xai-recode` | Canon kept, one structural inversion each: the tab row sits *below* the media (harness); numbered `1.0`/`1.1` markers turn five marketing sections into a document index (linear); the feature grid is pulled up *into* the hero, leaving five sections total (xai). |
| 5 | `mainframe-recode`, `umbrel-recode`, `reve-recode` | Skeleton rebuilt but still legible: seven short blocks under a header that scrolls away and never returns (mainframe); solo bands alternating with duet bands, then a store pivot (umbrel); seven capability panels alternating which edge they bleed off (reve). |
| 7 | `supercommon-recode` | "Void-Metered Stack" — testimonials, pricing table, FAQ, CTA band and any nav dropped outright; six consecutive sections share one `band` class and are told apart only by content; a single lowercase display line is the composition; no local asset anywhere. |

**`VISUAL_DENSITY` — how much is on screen per unit of scroll.**

| n | Page | What it looks like | What is on screen — counted on that folder's `index.html` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | `reve-recode` | One capability per `104svh`; the gutter is a slope, not a container, and text width is never capped by a wrapper. | **51 `<img>`, 2 `<video>`, 4 `<source>`.** A 13-card drifting strip in the hero, then one full-window editing panel per capability, each carrying paired before/after frames; two of the seven are live-embed slots. Sparse *vertically*. Never empty. |
| 2 | `supercommon-recode` | Extremely sparse vertically, tight typographically: exactly one padding value in the whole page. | **3 photographs + 1 looping video + 18 inline SVG pictograms.** The hero is a 3437×1905 image, full-bleed at `sizes="100vw"`, under a 30vh scrim (`.hero__ramp`); a 2048×2048 square carries the two words; a 3200×2203 screenshot carries the last band. The one page here with no *local* asset still puts four remote media on screen. |
| 4 | `mainframe-recode` | Editorial: a **single** 128px inter-block gap repeated everywhere, so page length comes from what a block contains and never from padding — six blocks over 5,752px at 1440. | **23 `<img>`.** One wallpaper used twice as a 140vh halo, a five-panel full-window carousel, five showcase `.webp` shipped twice over (two complete trees, one hidden per media query), five brand-rail logos, one 180px closing object. Every media surface is the same 10px inset-hairline frame. |
| 5 | `cursor-recode`, `fora-recode` | Airy between, dense within: the 24-column grid exists only *inside* large cards, never on the page (cursor); 36px card padding and 20px pricing rows inside airy sections (fora). | cursor: **18 `<img>`** (avatars and logos, 48–96px) **+ 20 inline SVG, 42 KB** — plus a phone drawn entirely in CSS and two floating product windows on a full-bleed plate. fora: **23 `<img>` + 38 inline SVG** — and *one* rendered app window carrying every claim, in the hero, then bled 272px off the CTA edge over a 190px horizon strip. |
| 6 | `umbrel-recode` | Deliberately tight — a 60px section stack at desktop that *rises* at narrower breakpoints, inverting the usual direction; ten sections in ~5,500px. | **42 `<img>` + 88 inline SVG, 75 KB — the largest drawn payload in the corpus.** Full-bleed product photography on each solo band, a five-card snap rail, a collage, and two marquees running in opposite directions. |
| 7 | `endlesstools-recode`, `linear-recode`, `xai-recode` | Split density, the mark of a high value done well: 8px gutters and 8px type inside the mosaic against 150px of nothing between sections (endlesstools); dense inside the mockups, `padding-block: 128px` around them (linear); dense without noise, five sections, every visual drawn in markup (xai). | endlesstools: **69 `<img>` + 20 `<video>`** — a 20-tile mosaic on a fixed 1200px scene, 8 image tiles, 14 review cards. linear: **25 `<img>` + 95 inline SVG** — six application-window mockups, each in a 22px frame with a bottom mask, plus animated dot matrices. xai: **7 `<img>` only** (three at 320px, four news thumbs at 1200×630) **+ 30 inline SVG** — a five-bubble conversation, a terminal with eight lines of output, a 3×2 mosaic, a waveform, a full-size code window, every one drawn in markup. |
| 9 | `harness-recode` | Counted, not felt: a four-column mega-menu, fifteen tab panels, an eight-field form and a fifteen-link footer column. | **91 `<img>` + 39 inline SVG + 2 `<video>` + 5 CSS `url()`.** The customer logos are declared three times over to feed the marquee; on top of that the mega-menu, the fifteen tab panels, the form and the footer column above. |

**Read the fourth column before you copy a number from the first.** Not one of the ten
holds a low density with an empty screen. `reve` and `supercommon` sit at the corpus floor
and still put fifty-one images and four media files in front of the reader; `xai` holds the
corpus's *highest* density on seven images, because it draws its interface in markup
instead of photographing it. A density value says how much scroll a given quantity of
matter is spread over. **It never says how much matter there is.** Copying `2` from `reve`
onto a page with nothing to show does not reproduce `reve` — it reproduces the number and
drops the page.

#### The screen-holding floor — checked at Gate 0, not after the build

A dial triple says how a page is *composed*. It says nothing about whether there is
anything to compose. Three facts together leave the reader with nothing to look at:

- `VISUAL_DENSITY` ≤ 3, **and**
- `DESIGN_VARIANCE` ≥ 6, **and**
- no visual asset available — no photography, no video, no product UI, no data, no map,
  no document, no object.

Each is legitimate on its own. Together they are not a direction, they are an empty page:
high variance drops the canonical furniture (card grids, logo walls, metric bands,
testimonials) that would otherwise have filled the screen; low density spreads what remains
over a long scroll; and with no asset there is nothing to put in the space the other two
just cleared. **The corpus contains no such page.** `supercommon`, its closest point at
7 · 2, still ships three photographs, a video and a metallic band.

The check is **countable, and it runs before code**. List what will physically be on screen,
block by block: every image, video, mockup, drawn interface, chart, table, full-bleed colour
field, and every type object large enough to be a composition in itself. If that list holds
fewer than one entry per planned section, one of three things has to change, and the plan
says which:

1. **Raise the density** — bring back the furniture the variance dropped, and *treat* it
   (per-section padding rhythm, a rule crossing section boundaries) instead of leaving it
   plain. `fora` at variance 3 is a corpus reference precisely for this.
2. **Manufacture the matter.** Drawn matter counts, and it is the answer when the brief
   supplies no photography: `xai` holds density 7 on seven images by building its interface
   out of markup; `supercommon` makes a whole band out of a gradient and one 56px line;
   `mainframe` makes two halos out of a single image cut by opposite alpha masks.

   **When the brief does supply usable photography, manufacturing matter instead is not a
   neutral choice** — it is refusing what the subject actually has, and a page that then
   labels a section "photographed" over nothing but drawings contradicts itself in public.
   Drawing is a way of filling a screen; it is never a way out of using the client's
   images. Use them, and draw around them. And where the brief supplies none, a free-stock
   image is still reachable before a drawing is — sourcing rules live in
   `design-web/references/photos-images.md`, the source hierarchy is enforced at
   `design-review/references/pre-flight-checklist.md` check 15.

   **Better still, carry both — they reinforce each other.** Drawing and photography are not
   competitors, and a page holding both holds better than a page holding either alone. The
   division of labour is clean: the photograph carries matter, light, the real thing; the
   drawing carries structure, measure, and what the eye cannot see on its own — a section, a
   survey line, a scale, a before/after. Real estate and architecture are the plain case: a
   plan or a cross-section set beside a photograph of the place says what neither says
   alone, the photograph showing what it is like and the drawing how it is made. One limit,
   and it is intention: an SVG pictogram parked next to a photo is not this — this is a
   drawing that tells the reader something the photograph cannot.
3. **Lower the variance** — a canonical skeleton at least arrives with its own blocks.

What is never an answer is shipping the triple and letting body copy carry three screens on
its own. Type at scale *is* matter — but only when it is the declared signature and treated
as an object, the way `supercommon`'s solitary display line opens the page, then every band
after it, then returns split in two. Type left at body scale over an empty band is not a
composition; it is a page that failed to get made.

**`MOTION_INTENSITY` — how much of the page moves, and how far.**

| n | Page | What it looks like |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `reve-recode` | 0 `@keyframes`, 4 transitions, no scroll reveal anywhere; the hero video fades up over 150ms only once frames are proven to be rendering. |
| 3 | `linear-recode` | `translateY(4px)` on entry, `scale(.97)` on press; eighteen curves declared and not one bounces. Nothing moves; everything settles. |
| 3 | `xai-recode` | 182 transition triggers, 73% of which move nothing — they change a colour. Five duration tiers ruled by "the bigger the element, the slower it is". |
| 3 | `cursor-recode` | One reveal keyframe for the whole page, always declared and *paused*; JS only lifts the pause, so a failed script leaves everything visible. Buttons declare no transition at all, on purpose. |
| 4 | `umbrel-recode`, `supercommon-recode` | Three named entrance variants plus two marquees and a `scroll-snap` rail (umbrel); three durations, two curves, one 60ms cascade step and no one-off value anywhere else (supercommon). |
| 6 | `mainframe-recode` | Total coverage, minimal amplitude: 75 transitions, zero keyframes applied, two duration regimes — response at 150/200ms, reveal at 400–1000ms — with a deliberate hole between them. |
| 6 | `harness-recode`, `fora-recode`, `endlesstools-recode` | Entrances differentiated by role, with a 300ms gap so the light arrives after the object (harness); `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` accordions and `mask-image` hairlines (fora); one curve on eleven of twelve transitions plus twenty running videos (endlesstools). |

Read the corpus honestly on one point: at 6, motion is **coverage**, not amplitude —
mainframe and harness earn a 6 because every state is covered by a documented system, not
because anything is spectacular. **6 is also the corpus ceiling**: no page on disk plays a
pinned, scrubbed or parallax sequence, so from 7 up the scale has poles but no anchor. A
brief that lands at 8 is not thereby wrong — it is unanchored, and the obligations under
*A high value commits you to producing something* below are the only thing holding it. Say
in the plan that nothing in the corpus demonstrates the value you claimed.

Notches nobody occupies — 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10 on variance; 1, 3, 8, 10 on density; 1, 2, 5,
7, 8, 9, 10 on motion — are not forbidden. Where the notch sits *between* two occupied
ones, interpolate and say what the in-between buys you; where it sits *above* everything
(variance 8+, motion 7+), there is nothing to interpolate from and the number is a promise
with no precedent — treat it accordingly. And note what the corpus does *not* contain:
**no page is high on all three axes.** Every one of the ten gives something up — harness
is a 9 in density but a 4 in variance; supercommon is a 7 in variance but a 2 in density;
reve sits at the corpus floor on two axes at once, 5 · 2 · 3, and is the only page that
does. A brief that arrives at 8/8/8 has not made a choice, it has made a wish.

One more thing the comparison exposes, and it now cuts both ways. Where a preset row sits
*below* what the subject supports, the corpus proves it: the "SaaS / product landing"
default is 4 · 5 · 4 where `harness-recode`, a SaaS landing, ships 4 · 9 · 6 — and no
preset row anywhere reaches the 9 that harness holds. But two rows sit *above* everything
on disk — agency 8 · 4 · 7 and luxury 5 · 3 · 7 both claim a variance or a motion value no
page here occupies. Those two are unanchored in this corpus, so a brief landing on one of
them cannot check its number against anything. Either way the rule is the same: the
presets are a safe starting point for a thin brief, never a target, and the dial is argued
from the subject.

### Setting a dial is a decision, not a field

Each dial is argued from the subject in the same breath as the register and the tone,
appended to the Design Read line:

```
Dials: DESIGN_VARIANCE n · VISUAL_DENSITY n · MOTION_INTENSITY n — because {what in the subject demands it}.
```

A law firm at `DESIGN_VARIANCE 8` owes exactly the sentence a fashion label at 3 owes.
Neither number is wrong; an unargued one always is.

**A low value is not a low score.** `fora` at variance 3, `cursor` at 3, `reve` at density
2 — all judged good. What separates a chosen low value from a timid one is that it is
executed to the end: fora commits to a single 1px rule and uses nothing else; reve gives one
capability the whole screen and never crowds it. A low value assumed and carried through
beats a high value claimed and not delivered, every time.

**The middle is suspect.** Three 5s across three axes is the signature of a decision not
made. It is not banned — but it is worth knowing that **no page in the corpus carries a 5 on
more than one axis**. The two pages closest to the middle each buy it with a named device:
`umbrel` (5 · 6 · 4) with its solo/duet alternation, `mainframe` (5 · 4 · 6) with a brand
page that argues in the product register. So: if two or more dials land at 5, the plan says
in one line why the middle is the answer here, or moves one of them. Flag it as such — a
silent 5/5/5 is the failure this rule exists to catch.

**A high value commits you to producing something.** The number is a promise the deliverable
has to keep:

- `DESIGN_VARIANCE` ≥ 7 obliges a macrostructure that visibly departs from the canon **and**
  a signature procedure derived from the subject, applied more than once. `supercommon` is
  the only page here that clears 7, and it carries both: its solitary display line opens the
  page and then every band after it, then returns split in two as `stillness.` / `motion.`;
  and its voids are metered — each silence sized to the block behind it, the two largest
  (32vh, 40vh) reserved for the two blocks the page most wants read. Without both, high
  variance is novelty, not direction.
- `VISUAL_DENSITY` ≥ 7 obliges a counted inventory of what is on screen **and** two spacing
  regimes — dense inside blocks, airy between them. Every high-density page in the corpus
  splits this way. Density without the second regime is noise.
- `VISUAL_DENSITY` ≤ 3 obliges **the same counted inventory**, for the opposite reason: it
  has to show that something still holds each screen. See *The screen-holding floor* above,
  and the fourth column of the density table — both corpus pages at 2 are carrying real
  matter. A low density with nothing counted is not restraint, it is an empty page.
- `MOTION_INTENSITY` ≥ 6 obliges a documented motion system: the material list, the duration
  set, the curve set, and entrances differentiated by role rather than one blanket reveal.
  Above 7, add a named scroll mechanism and its `prefers-reduced-motion` path.

If the deliverable does not carry the obligation, **lower the dial in the plan rather than
ship the number** — a claimed 8 that the page does not hold is the more expensive
mistake, because every downstream move inherits it.

The macrostructure pick and `DESIGN_VARIANCE` must agree. A canonical skeleton is a 3; a
rebuilt-but-legible one a 5; dropped sections and a bespoke order a 7, which is where the
corpus stops — no page on disk shows what an 8 or a 9 costs to hold. A plan naming the
canonical skeleton next to `DESIGN_VARIANCE 8` has one of the two wrong — resolve it before
Gate 0, not while coding.

## Gate 0 — Brief Lock

Before routing to any target skill — before writing or modifying a single line of
HTML/CSS/tokens — six artefacts must exist **in writing**, not just in your head:

0. **Register** — resolved above, stated explicitly (not defaulted).
1. **Tone** committed to ONE extreme — not an adjective that could also describe three
   competitors. Where it comes from depends on whether tone is one of the axes the
   Exploration Gate put in play:

   - **Explored** — the gate fans out 3 divergent, text-only direction sketches judged
     blind and comparatively by `challenger`, and the winner's tone becomes
     this artefact. The gate runs before Step 1 of `generate` **wherever that move has a
     page body to decide** — it is no longer a single scope/register special case.
   - **Not explored** — either no gate ran, or it ran on a reduced axis list because tone
     was already arbitrated in writing. Tone is then stated directly: `generate` derives it
     from the brief, refinement moves inherit it from the existing surface and name it.
     Inheriting is not skipping — an inherited tone left unstated fails this gate exactly
     like a missing one.

   Which case applies, and which axes each scope × register combination puts in play, is
   defined **once**, in the scope table of `references/moves/generate.md` (§Exploration
   Gate). Read it there. **It is deliberately not restated here** — two copies of one rule
   are two rules that drift apart, and that file also owns the mechanics, the "reduced is
   not lighter" rule, and the fallback.

   The fallback survives unchanged and is the only route back to an unexplored direction
   when the gate was due: `Task`/`Agent` unavailable at nesting depth 5 → the direct single
   pick, and the report marked "direction not explored / single-fiat". Never a silent one.
2. **Signature element** (brand register) or **primary task** (product register) named in
   one sentence.
3. **The corpus actually seen, then read** — in that order, and both halves are required:

   - **at least two of the ten pages opened in a browser and scrolled through**, named in
     the plan as `{reference}-recode/index.html`. They open by double-click, `file://`, no
     server, no build;
   - `design-web/references/refs-design/README.md` plus at least two `tokens-*.md`
     sections, cited by reference and section name.

   This is the evidence artefact, per `design-web/references/design-inspiration.md`.
   **Sections cited with no page opened does not satisfy it.** Measured values let you
   reproduce a procedure, never choose one, and a corpus of taste that is only ever read
   hands back conformity instead of judgment — the failure is documented at
   `design-web/references/refs-design/README.md` §*Look before you read*. A sector URL or a
   supplied screenshot is an addition to this artefact, never a substitute for either half.

4. **What will be on screen, counted** — one list, block by block, of the images, videos,
   mockups, drawn interfaces, charts, tables, full-bleed colour fields and display-scale
   type objects the page will actually carry. Required unconditionally, and decisive
   whenever `VISUAL_DENSITY` ≤ 3 or `DESIGN_VARIANCE` ≥ 6: see *The screen-holding floor*
   above for what to do when the count comes up short. A plan that names a dial triple but
   cannot say what fills the screen has not been made.
5. **Structure named, both halves** — one line in the plan:

   ```
   Macrostructure: {hero treatment from references/macrostructure-bank.md} + {body sequence from references/body-sequence-bank.md}
   ```

   Naming one without the other fails this gate. The two banks are separate on purpose:
   the hero bank owns the **first screen only**, the body-sequence bank owns **everything
   after it**. The body, not the hero, is the documented failure mode
   (`references/register/brand.md` intro) — a plan that names a hero treatment and stops
   has improvised the scroll, and improvised scrolls converge on the same
   feature-grid-then-testimonials default the corpus was assembled to break. So an unnamed
   body sequence is a missing artefact, not a detail to settle while coding.

   Restate the sequence's ordering principle in the brief's own terms, not the bank's
   label: "four chambers, one image transformation each" is a body sequence, "alternating"
   is a word. And the pick has to agree with `DESIGN_VARIANCE` (see the dial section
   above) — a canonical skeleton and a variance of 8 cannot both be true.

   Where the Exploration Gate ran, this pair is **its output, not a fresh pick**: the
   winning sketch's hero treatment + body sequence, carried forward with its principle
   line. Recording it satisfies this artefact; re-deciding it discards the comparison that
   was just paid for. Where no gate ran, pick both from the banks here.

This is a **present/absent check on six named artefacts** — structural, not a taste
judgment. One missing ⇒ **generation or modification is forbidden** until it exists.
Mechanics of artefacts 1–2 (the Exploration Gate and its scope table, brief questions,
signature element, two-pass critique) live in `references/moves/generate.md`; the two banks
own the vocabulary of artefact 5. This section is only the checkpoint every move respects
before it's allowed to touch code — it says *what must exist*, never *how it was produced*.

## Design guidance

Dense and general, applying whichever move is running — taste rules specific to one move
live in that move's file.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse, unconditional across both registers — not a statistical reflex to weigh,
a hard stop. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with a different
structure, never a variation on the same idea.

- **Side-stripe borders** — `border-left`/`border-right` >1px as a colored accent on cards,
  list items, callouts, or alerts. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading
  numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text** — `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background.
  Decorative, never meaningful. Single solid color; emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default** — blurs/glass cards used decoratively rather than rare and
  purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template** — big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient
  accent. SaaS cliché; see `register/brand.md` §2 "Ribbon 4-stats" furniture for the fix.
- **Identical card grids** — same-sized cards, icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought** — modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline/progressive
  alternatives first.
- **Em dash in copy** — commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses instead. Also
  not `--`.
- **The AI-slop signature triad** — defined here and canonical here; every other file in
  the pipeline points back to this bullet instead of restating it. Three tells that each
  pass on their own and together fingerprint the page:
  1. a **Tailwind blue/indigo primary or accent**, hue range 200–290°;
  2. **Inter as the primary typeface**;
  3. **`rounded-2xl` as the default radius**.

  That palette/font/radius combination is shared by **~83% of sampled AI-generated pages**
  (grounding: sailop ai-slop research). The figure belongs to this triad and to nothing
  else — never quote it for another ban, another detector, or a general anti-slop claim.

  Any two legs are survivable; the third is what makes the page identifiable. So if brand
  guidelines already fix 2 of the 3, the third MUST change — another hue, another radius,
  or another typeface (reflex-reject list and alternatives:
  `design-system/references/forbidden-fonts.md`). The corpus carries the counter-example:
  `fora-recode` and `umbrel-recode` both ship Inter and both read specific, because neither
  carries either of the other two legs.

Deterministic grep companions for the structural ones (side-stripe, identical grids,
nested cards, icon-bento): `design-review/references/anti-ai-slop-audit.md`.

### The AI-slop test — 2 levels

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed.
Run at **two altitudes** — the second catches what the first misses. Cross-register
failures are the Absolute bans above; register-specific failures live in each
`register/*.md`.

**First-order — category reflex.** If someone could guess the theme + palette from the
category alone, it's the first training-data reflex:

1. **Cream #F4F1EA + a contrasted serif + terracotta accent** — the default "editorial
   SaaS" look.
2. **Near-black background + one acid accent color** — the default "dark developer tool"
   look.
3. **Broadsheet hairlines, zero border-radius, black/white only** — the default "premium
   minimal" look.
4. **Glassmorphism + `rounded-2xl` used globally** — the default "2026 AI app" look,
   applied everywhere instead of gated (`design-motion` gates it deliberately).
5. **Generic icon-bento** — every cell centered text over a round colored-icon badge, zero
   image/gradient/pattern variation between cells.

Rework the Design Read's vibe words and the color strategy (`design-system` §Color
strategy) until the answer isn't obvious from the category — "observability → dark blue",
"healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black" are all this
tier. Purple-on-white gradients are banned outright regardless of tier — the single most
common tell.

**Second-order — category-plus-anti-reference trap.** The first reflex was avoided, but if
someone could still guess the aesthetic *family* from category-plus-anti-references — "AI
workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not
navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode" — it's the trap one tier deeper. Rework until
neither answer is obvious. Register-specific reflex-reject aesthetic lanes:
`register/brand.md` and `register/product.md`.

Deterministic grep detectors cover the first-order clusters plus the Absolute bans; the
second-order trap is judgment, checked at the challenger gate
(`design-review/references/review-procedure.md`), not grep-lintable.

### Macrostructure variety — hero AND body

Centered hero + 3-column icon-card grid is forbidden as a default skeleton. Before any plan
is finalized, name **two** picks: a hero treatment from `references/macrostructure-bank.md`
(first screen only) and a body sequence from `references/body-sequence-bank.md` (everything
after it, with its ordering principle restated in the brief's own terms). A plan carrying
only a hero treatment has improvised the scroll — the body is the documented failure mode.

Following the canon is a legitimate pick. `fora-recode`'s "Bookended Canon" runs the
canonical skeleton almost to the letter and does not read generic, because one device — a
single 1px rule at white 10% — is carried through every edge, card and divider.
`endlesstools-recode` keeps the same order and fills every slot with footage. Departing is
equally legitimate: `supercommon-recode`'s "Void-Metered Stack" drops the testimonials, the
pricing table, the FAQ, the CTA band and the nav outright — the price is inline on one
button and the exit is a single link with no headline above it. What is never legitimate is
**not choosing** — the skeleton that arrived by default is the one that reads as generated.

Let each pick follow the subject, not habit: a treatment or a sequence reused by reflex
across briefs becomes its own template, whichever one it is. A pick used on two consecutive
briefs has to be argued from the second subject or replaced — the fact that it worked once
is not an argument.

### Non-negotiable floor

Regardless of tone, register, target, or move, every deliverable must have: responsive
behavior across the target's breakpoints/size classes; visible keyboard focus on every
interactive element (`:focus-visible`, never suppressed); `prefers-reduced-motion`
respected wherever motion is added.

### Generation approach

Generate HTML/CSS directly — the default and primary path, following the same method as
Anthropic's official `frontend-design` skill (commit to a point of view, avoid templated
defaults, verify with tools not vibes). Gemini Design MCP, Magic (21st.dev) and shadcn MCP
are optional conveniences, never a requirement; direct generation is always the fallback.
Mobile targets (`design-ios`, `design-android`) never generate SwiftUI or Compose — they
produce token specs, an HTML device-framed mockup, and a platform handoff spec.

### Frozen taste data — canonical home, read from source, never restated

| Concern | Path |
|---|---|
| Token strategy (color/type/spacing) + `design-system.md` format | `skills/design-system/SKILL.md` |
| Sector palettes | `skills/design-system/references/sector-palettes.md` |
| Typography pairs | `skills/design-system/references/typography-pairs.md` |
| OKLCH color mechanics | `skills/design-system/references/oklch-system.md` |
| Forbidden fonts (canonical) | `skills/design-system/references/forbidden-fonts.md` |
| Buttons | `skills/design-web/references/buttons-guide.md` |
| Cards | `skills/design-web/references/cards-guide.md` |
| Spacing / density | `skills/design-system/references/spacing-density.md` |
| Layout hard rules | `skills/design-web/references/layout-discipline.md` |
| Visual design technique | `skills/design-web/references/ui-visual-design.md` |
| Hero treatments (first screen only) | `skills/design-method/references/macrostructure-bank.md` |
| Body sequences (section order after the hero) | `skills/design-method/references/body-sequence-bank.md` |
| Reference corpus (taste source; also the anchor set for the 3 dials) — **the ten `index.html` are opened and scrolled FIRST, the markdown second** | `skills/design-web/references/refs-design/{reference}-recode/index.html`, then `refs-design/README.md` §*Look before you read*, then the `tokens-*.md` it indexes |
| Dial presets by use-case, partial-brief fallbacks, `MOTION_INTENSITY` bands | `skills/design-system/references/design-read-dials.md` (the anchored scale itself lives in this file, §Design Read) |
| Premium layout patterns | `skills/design-web/references/premium-patterns/PATTERNS.md` |
| Component composition | `skills/design-web/references/component-composition-ref.md` |
| Taste sourcing order (corpus first, then 1-2 sector sites for register only) + the canonical Lookalike Test | `skills/design-web/references/design-inspiration.md` (+ `-urls.md`) |

## Routing

1. **Read `../design-system/SKILL.md`** (Setup step 2) — first step of routing, not
   optional, not conditional on `design-system.md` already existing.

**Moves** — the one file each dispatches to owns the step-by-step procedure and the report
template; read it, don't reinvent it.

| # | Move | When to use | File |
|---|------|-------------|------|
| 2 | **generate** | Nothing built yet — new page, app screen, component, or mobile mockup | `references/moves/generate.md` |
| 3 | **critique** | UX design review of an existing surface — hierarchy, clarity, emotional resonance | `references/moves/critique.md` |
| 4 | **audit** | Technical quality pass — a11y, contrast, responsive, token adherence | `references/moves/audit.md` |
| 5 | **bolder** | Design reads as timid/generic for its committed tone — commit harder, don't add elements | `references/moves/bolder.md` |
| 6 | **quieter** | Design reads as loud/overloaded — dial back intensity | `references/moves/quieter.md` |
| 7 | **distill** | Design reads as overloaded with elements — strip to essence | `references/moves/distill.md` |
| 8 | **harden** | Error states, i18n, text overflow, edge cases missing | `references/moves/harden.md` |
| 9 | **polish** | Final pass before shipping — design-system alignment, last-mile detail | `references/moves/polish.md` |
| 10 | **redesign** | Total redesign/refonte of an EXISTING surface — rethink structure/layout/typography/composition from scratch, keep the existing color palette, never copy-paste the old design | `references/moves/redesign.md` |

**Target skill chain** — which skill(s) the matched move (typically `generate`) routes
into next, per platform, once `design-system/SKILL.md` has already been read (step 1):

| Platform | Chain |
|---|---|
| Web (marketing/landing) | `design-web` → `design-motion` → `design-review` |
| Web app (dashboard/SaaS) | `design-webapp` → `design-motion` → `design-review` |
| iOS | `design-ios` → `design-review` |
| Android | `design-android` → `design-review` |
| Copy only | `ux-copy` (any point in the pipeline) |

Scope (FULL / PAGE / COMPONENT / MOBILE — how much sourcing and audit depth a `generate`
run needs) is resolved inside `references/moves/generate.md`, not here.

## Next

Read the matched move file from the Routing table above. Token/contrast mechanics live in
`design-system` (already read at step 1); the final quality gate — deterministic checks +
the challenger gate — lives in `design-review`.
