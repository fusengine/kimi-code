## Premium Patterns — Section Devices, Never Page Structure

**These files give section decoration. They never give a page structure.**
Each of the ten carries exactly one technique living inside a single section:
a numbering treatment, a hover reveal, a letter with a photo clipped into it,
a tab crossfade. None of them describes a page, an order of sections, or a
scroll.

Structure comes from two other files, and only from them:

- **First screen** — `../../../design-method/references/macrostructure-bank.md`,
  eight hero treatments plus the forbidden centered-hero default.
- **Body** — `../../../design-method/references/body-sequence-bank.md`, eleven
  body sequences read off shipped code, each with the principle that decides
  its order and what it drops from the canon. Its rule 2 is the one that
  matters here: *the canon is not the enemy, uniform treatment of it is* —
  `fora` sets vertical padding section by section
  (160/180/180/160/180/180/180) rather than one value everywhere.

A plan names one of each — `Macrostructure: {hero treatment} + {body sequence}`
— before this file is opened. If you are reading here to decide what sections a
page has, you are in the wrong file.

> **Why the amputation.** Until 2026-07 each of these ten files carried a full
> Nav → … → Footer walkthrough plus an "AI Generation Prompt" that prescribed
> every one of those sections in order, with values. Fusing two of them built a
> macrostructure by collage — the exact failure the rest of this skill bans, and
> worse than a browsed template because the output was executable. The
> walkthroughs and the page prompts are gone. What remains per file: the device,
> its measured CSS, its conditions of use, and — where one exists — the shipped
> feedback that qualifies it.

### Source URLs are provenance, not a destination

Each `description.md` frontmatter keeps its `source:` URL. It records where the
device was measured, which is honest traceability. It is **not** an invitation
to open the site and lift taste from it — `../design-inspiration.md` owns that
ban and it is unchanged. Read the values here; do not go back to the source.

### How to use

1. Confirm the hero treatment and body sequence are already decided
   (`../../../design-method/SKILL.md`, Pass 1). This file supplies neither.
2. Identify the ONE already-planned section that needs a craft treatment.
3. Read ONE `description.md`. Apply its device to that section only.
4. Run the section against the Body Substance Floor below — a device wrapped
   around generic copy is decorated slop, not solved slop.
5. Numeric limits stay with `../layout-discipline.md` (hero caps, eyebrow cap,
   zigzag cap, bento N=N, section-repetition ban, measure floor). Nothing here
   overrides them; where a device could collide with one, its file says so.

**On combining.** Two devices on one page is a ceiling, not a target, and never
a checklist. They must land on two non-adjacent sections of two different
layout families (`../layout-discipline.md` §5). Do not combine prompts: one
device per section, at most.

### Pattern Index — the device each file carries

| # | Path | Device (one per file) |
|---|------|------------------------|
| 01 | `01-numbered-services/description.md` | Bracketed `[01]` index rows + hover image reveal |
| 02 | `02-alternating-sections/description.md` | Hard-cut background inversion at ONE boundary + sub-5% dot-grid watermark |
| 03 | `03-hero-badge-inline/description.md` | Pill badge and icon set inline in the H1 text flow |
| 04 | `04-bento-grid/description.md` | Asymmetric bento cell mix (2x2 / 2x1 / 1x1) |
| 05 | `05-fullbleed-hero/description.md` | Oversized low-opacity wordmark watermark + hue-tinted image overlay |
| 06 | `06-gradient-steps/description.md` | Oversized ghost numeral as card background texture |
| 07 | `07-cta-giant-typography/description.md` | Photograph clipped inside 1-2 display letters (`background-clip: text`) |
| 08 | `08-radical-alternation/description.md` | One serif-italic connector word inside a sans display heading — gated |
| 09 | `09-tabs-image-swap/description.md` | Pill-in-pill tab bar crossfading a paired image + text |
| 10 | `10-accordion-carousel/description.md` | Single-open accordion; horizontal snap carousel with peeking card |

### Illustrative Examples (NOT a sector lookup — cross-pollinate deliberately)

The "Historically common" column shows what has been reached for by default in
each sector — that is precisely the convergence risk, not a recommendation.
Treat it as a first-draft reference at most; picking from the "Consider instead"
column, or a device outside both, is often the better choice specifically
because it isn't the sector default. State the choice against the POV, same
discipline as `macrostructure-bank.md`'s "deliberate exception, not a default
reached by omission":

| Sector | Historically common | Consider instead |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| SaaS | 02, 04, 06 | 01, 07 (bold typography breaks SaaS sameness) |
| Agency/Creative | 01, 07, 08 | 04, 09 (structured grid breaks agency chaos-default) |
| Fintech | 04, 06, 09 | 05, 08 (dramatic contrast breaks fintech blue-sameness) |
| Healthcare | 02, 05, 09 | 01, 10 (numbered/expandable breaks healthcare-calm sameness) |
| E-commerce | 03, 04, 10 | 07, 08 |
| Luxury | 05, 07, 08 | 09, 10 |
| B2B | 01, 09, 10 | 04, 06 |

The `seen-in:` key in each file's frontmatter records the sector the device was
measured in. Same status as `source:` — provenance, never a filter.

### Body Substance Floor (surface is not substance)

A page that stacks two of these devices but says nothing product/brand-specific
has decorated the slop, not solved it. Before shipping any device, the section
using it must pass:

- **The Competitor Lift Test**
  (`../../../design-method/references/register/brand.md` §3) — could this
  section's copy and claim run unchanged on a competitor's site wearing the same
  device? If yes, the device is polishing filler.
- **A real, sourced claim** — the device's headline/number/step must carry an
  actual fact from the brief (a real metric, a real process step, a real product
  name), never an invented placeholder dressed up in a nice grid.
- **Domain-Specificity**
  (`../../../design-method/references/register/product.md` §2, when register is
  `product`) — would this surface look native dropped unedited into an unrelated
  product?

A beautiful hover reveal over a generic "Fast. Reliable. Scalable." headline
still fails.

### Flatness is banned — and so is one mandatory recipe for relief

The list below names failures. It deliberately does **not** prescribe a single
cure, because a cure applied everywhere becomes the next tell: strict
light/dark alternation on every boundary is itself an AI signature (see 02), and
a mandatory 3-level shadow on every card reads as a framework default.

| Failure | Why it fails | Ways out (pick one, deliberately) |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Every section on the same background with no other relief device | The page reads as one undifferentiated column | ONE inverted band; a tinted section; a full-bleed image section; per-section vertical padding rhythm (`body-sequence-bank.md` rule 2); a rule or motif crossing section boundaries |
| Display headline sized like body copy (register `brand`) | No focal block — `../layout-discipline.md` §9 fails | Scale the display type, or give the viewport its focal block another way (image, number, full-bleed panel). `../layout-discipline.md` §1 owns the hero numbers, not this file. Register `product` is exempt |
| Cards with no border AND no tint AND no elevation AND no image | The card is invisible; the grid reads as loose text | Any ONE of border, tint, elevation, image. Not all four, and not a mandatory 3-level shadow scale |
| A raw `<ul>` of more than 5 service items | Already a `../layout-discipline.md` §7 fail | Numbered rows (01), accordion (10), tabs (09), 2-col split, scroll-snap pills |
| A closing CTA that restates the hero verbatim | The page ends with nothing new | Give the closing ask its own device (07, 05) or its own content — a form, a real availability, a named next step |
| Any device applied to generic/unsourced copy | See Body Substance Floor | Fix the copy; the device is not the problem |
