## Read First

Taste is extracted, never cloned. Palette, typography, depth, craft technique:
yes. Section flow, spacing rhythm, skeleton: never — structure comes from
`design-method/references/register/brand.md` (or `product.md`) plus
`design-method/references/macrostructure-bank.md`.

That rule has not changed. What changed is **where you look**.

## Primary source — the local corpus

```
./refs-design/README.md          (next to this file, inside the skill)
```

Ten references, all of them public pages rebuilt by hand from their live source
and accepted by the owner. Each folder carries two files: `tokens-<name>.md` for how the
page is made (procedures, measured values, traps) and `design-system.md` for what
it decided and why (register, tone, signature element, section sequence). Roughly
6 500 lines of tokens and 25 indexed procedures across the corpus.

**Open `README.md` first.** It holds the procedure index: which technique lives
in which reference, and in which section of its `tokens-*.md`.

Why this beats a template gallery, concretely:

| A screenshot gives you | `tokens-*.md` gives you |
|---|---|
| what it looks like | the mechanism, with its measured values |
| a result | the trap that breaks it elsewhere |
| one viewport | what the author deliberately did not reproduce |

Example: a capture of a scroll-collapsing nav shows a pill. `tokens-fora.md`
§ 5 quinquies gives the scrim, the blur radius, the two distinct top offsets
for resting and scrolled state, and why the pill needs more clearance than the
bare bar.

The corpus is frozen and measured — that is the whole advantage over a browsed
site, which changes under you and gives you pixels only. It is **not** offline:
all ten load images or video from the network and nine load their typefaces too —
no folder here is self-contained — and two pages (`harness`,
`reve`) fetch their woff2 from a third-party CDN that can purge it. Offline the
renders degrade — fallback fonts, `alt` text
in place of images — but the measured values stay readable in the markdown, which
is what you came for. `README.md` has the per-folder count.

## Second source — real sites in the client's actual sector

The corpus carries **one** register: dark tech product, all ten of them. It will
not hand you the register for a driving school, a law practice, a bakery — and it
holds no counter-example to show you what one would look like at this level of
execution. **That comes from the subject**, and the
fastest way to see how a sector actually presents itself is to look at real
companies in it — not at templates built to be interchangeable.

Read `fuse-browser-usage` before the first `mcp__fuse-browser__*` call —
it decides fetch vs live session vs capture, and carries the zero-tolerance rules.

Use `mcp__fuse-browser__browser_serp_batch` on the project's real vertical, then
browse 1–2 actual production sites. Award galleries (`awwwards.com/websites/`,
`godly.website`, `bestwebsite.gallery`) are useful for one thing only: they link
out to real production sites. Follow those links; do not extract from the
gallery page itself.

## What was removed, and why

This file used to list roughly a hundred Framer and Webflow template slugs.
They are gone. Its own text carried the diagnosis:

> Every generated page pulling from the same ~100 templates is the root cause
> of the generic-body problem this file used to encode.

Marketing templates are built to be interchangeable — that is their product
requirement. Extracting taste from them converges every output toward the same
body. The corpus replaces them because it offers the opposite: idiosyncratic,
production-grade pages whose craft is documented rather than guessed.

## Citing sources

Whatever was actually used — corpus references and browsed sites alike — goes in
the `design-system.md` "Design Reference" block. `mainframe-recode/design-system.md`
shows the form: source URL and stack listed, and one line on what the palette was
sampled from — there, "sampled from nothing", with the reason on the next line.
