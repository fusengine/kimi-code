# Microcopy Patterns

## CTA Patterns

| Context | Examples | Research note |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Primary** | "Get started", "Create project", "Start free trial" | Action verb + noun; +28% conversion vs generic |
| **Secondary** | "Learn more", "View details", "See pricing" | Exploratory, lower urgency |
| **Destructive** | "Delete account", "Cancel subscription", "Remove data" | Explicit + irreversible warning required |
| **Link** | "Forgot password?", "Need help?", "View all" | Minimal styling, no urgency |

| **Create** | "Create project", "Create account" — specific action |
| **Download** | "Download now", "Download report" — clear deliverable |
| **Try** | "Try for free", "Try it now" — low commitment |
| **Join** | "Join free", "Join 10k teams" — community |
