| Middle | "Step 2 of 4 — Almost there!" | "Just a few more details" |
| End | "You're all set!" | "Your account is ready. Start exploring." |

---

## Success Confirmations

**Rule**: Celebrate briefly, then move forward. No over-celebration.

| Context | Good | Avoid |
|---------|------|-------|

| Settings saved | "Changes saved" | "Wow, great job saving your settings!" |
| Account setup | "You're all set! Head to your dashboard." | "Congratulations on completing setup!" |

---

## Loading States

**Rule**: Context-aware messages. Never just "Please wait."

| Context | Message |
|---------|---------|
| Dashboard | "Loading your dashboard..." |
| Reports | "Fetching your latest data..." |
| File upload | "Uploading file (42%)..." |
| Long operation | "This may take a moment. Hang tight." |
