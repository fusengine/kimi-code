# Anti-AI-Slop Audit

## What is AI Slop?

AI slop is the statistical convergence toward the same defaults every generator reaches
for absent a deliberate constraint — same palette family, same macrostructure, same
component silhouettes. It reads as "generated with zero customization," regardless of
stack (this audit runs against the generated HTML/CSS, not a specific framework).

## Canonical Sources (referenced, not restated)

- The 3 default-look clusters (cream+serif+terracotta / near-black+acid-accent /
  broadsheet-hairlines) and their evolutions (glassmorphism+`rounded-2xl` everywhere,
  generic round-icon bento) — `design-method` SKILL.md, "Anti-Slop" section.
- Forbidden fonts list — `design-system` SKILL.md, "Forbidden Fonts" section.
- Contrast thresholds (4.5:1 text / 3:1 UI) — `design-system/references/contrast-ratios.md`.

## Deterministic Blacklist (grep the generated HTML/CSS)

Each entry: pattern → detection → imposed alternative. Run on the actual output, not a
specific framework's source tree — the pipeline defaults to vanilla HTML/CSS + OKLCH.

| # | Pattern | Detection | Imposed alternative |
|---|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Forbidden font, undeclared | `grep -ri "font-family" *.html *.css` against the `design-system` forbidden list | Approved pair from `design-system/references/typography-pairs.md` |
| 2 | Purple/indigo gradient tell | `grep -riE "linear-gradient" *.css \| grep -iE "#6366f1\|#8b5cf6\|#a855f7\|oklch\([^)]*2[7-9][0-9]|oklch\([^)]*30[0-9]"` (hue ~270-300°) | Sector OKLCH palette from `design-system`: **committed color** — either chromatic (chroma ≥ 0.05) or an intentional near-mono base with one sharp accent, non-purple hue. The slop is a timid, non-committed gray, not low chroma itself (Linear/Vercel/Stripe ship near-mono premium) |
| 3 | Uniform low-alpha shadow | `grep -o "box-shadow:[^;]*" *.css \| grep -oE "0\.0[0-9]\|0\.1[0-2]"` on every card/button, no variation | Elevation scale with varied alpha/blur per depth level |
| 4 | Identical corner-radius everywhere | `grep -o "border-radius:[^;]*" *.css \| sort -u` returns exactly 1 value across all component types | One radius scale (e.g. sm/md/lg), applied by component role, not a single flat value |
| 5 | Hero-centered + 3-icon-cards macrostructure | Structural: `grep -qE 'class="[^"]*text-center[^"]*"[^>]*>\s*<h1'` (centered `h1`) followed by a `grid`/`flex` container whose child count is `grep -ocE '<(div\|li)[^>]*class="[^"]*(card\|icon)[^"]*"'` == 3, each containing an `<svg`/icon-class element | Pick a non-default macrostructure per `design-method` "Macrostructure Variety" |
| 6 | Eyebrow/badge above every `h2` | Count uppercase-tracking labels immediately preceding section headlines; compare to `design-review/references/pre-flight-checklist.md` cap | Drop the eyebrow on repeat sections; headline alone is enough |
| 7 | Colored side-border / side-tab / side-stripe accent cards | `grep -oE "border-(left|right):[^;]*" *.css` present on every card in a grid, OR a `::before`/`::after` pseudo-element sized as a thin colored stripe/tab on the card edge | Depth/hierarchy via elevation, size, or fill — not a uniform accent stripe/tab |
| 8 | "Steps 1-2-3" numbered list pattern | Structural: `STEPS=$(grep -ocE '<(div\|li)[^>]*>\s*<(span\|div)[^>]*>0?[1-3]</(span\|div)>' "$FILE")`; `[ "$STEPS" -ge 3 ]` AND all matched cards share one `class="..."` shell (`grep -oE 'class="[^"]*step[^"]*"' "$FILE" \| sort -u \| wc -l` == 1) | Asymmetric process treatment (timeline, connected path, varied card sizes) |
| 9 | Cluster #1 signature co-occurrence (cream + serif + italic-accent + terracotta), undeclared | `CREAM=$(grep -qiE 'background(-color)?:\s*(oklch\([^)]*0\.9[0-8][^)]*(6[0-9]\|[7-8][0-9]\|9[0-9])\)\|#f4f1ea\|#f7f5f1)' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; `SERIF_ITALIC=$(grep -qiE 'font-family:[^;]*serif' "$FILE" && grep -qiE 'font-style:\s*italic' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; `TERRACOTTA=$(grep -qiE '#b6553a\|#bc7c3a\|oklch\([^)]*0\.1[0-9][^)]*(3[0-9]\|4[0-9])\)' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; sum ≥ 2/3 | If ≥2/3 present **and** not declared as the Step 2 signature element (`design-method`): **FLAG-with-justification**, not a BLOCK — a declared deliberate signature is a valid override |
| 10 | Cluster #2 signature co-occurrence (near-black background + acid accent), undeclared | `NEARBLACK=$(grep -qiE 'background(-color)?:\s*(oklch\([^)]*0?\.[01][0-9]?%?\|#0[0-9a-f]{5}\|#1[0-4][0-9a-f]{4})' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; `ACID=$(grep -qiE 'oklch\([^)]*0\.[2-9][0-9][^)]*\)' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; sum ≥ 2/2 | Both present, undeclared as signature: **FLAG-with-justification**, not a BLOCK — same override rule as #9 |
| 11 | Cluster #3 signature co-occurrence (broadsheet hairlines + zero-radius + mono), undeclared | `RADIUS0=$(grep -oE "border-radius:[^;]*" *.css \| sort -u \| grep -qE '^\s*border-radius:\s*0(px)?;?\s*$' && echo 1)`; `MONO=$(grep -qi 'font-family:[^;]*mono' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; `HAIRLINE=$(grep -qiE 'border(-top\|-bottom)?:\s*1px solid' "$FILE" && echo 1)`; sum ≥ 2/3 | If ≥2/3 present, undeclared as signature: **FLAG-with-justification**, not a BLOCK — same override rule as #9 |
| 12 | Nested cards (card-in-card depth) | Structural: a `.card`/`[class*="card"]` element containing another `.card`/`[class*="card"]` descendant beyond 1 level — `grep -ozE '<[^>]*class="[^"]*card[^"]*"[^>]*>([^<]*<[^>]*>)*?[^<]*<[^>]*class="[^"]*card[^"]*"'` matching nested card markup, or a DOM check with ≥3 card-role ancestors | Cap nesting at 1 level; flatten with padding/dividers instead of a literal card-in-card |
| 13 | Grid of visually identical cards | Every card in one grid shares identical size, media treatment, and layout — no featured/larger/varied cell — `grep -oE 'class="[^"]*card[^"]*"' *.html \| sort \| uniq -c` returns one repeated class shell with zero size/media variation across the grid | Vary at least one card per grid (featured/larger span, image vs. icon-only, or asymmetric layout) |
| 14 | Icon-tile above heading, repeated (generic icon-bento) | A small square/rounded icon container immediately above a heading, repeated per card — `grep -ozE '<[^>]*class="[^"]*icon[^"]*"[^>]*>[^<]*(<[^>]*>[^<]*)*?</[a-z]+>\s*<h[2-4]'` (icon block directly followed by a heading). Same detector family as `design-method` Anti-Slop cluster #5 (generic icon-bento) — this entry is its deterministic grep companion, not a duplicate definition | Replace with image/gradient/pattern variation per `design-method` cluster #5 remediation |
| 15 | Generic body sequence — canonical section order verbatim **AND** one uniform vertical rhythm | **Conjunction: FAIL only if both (a) and (b) hold.** **(a) Canon order** — list the section markers in document order (`grep -oE '<section[^>]*(id\|class)="[^"]*"' "$FILE"`) and match against the canonical token set `hero, logos, features, steps/how-it-works, testimonials, pricing, faq, cta`: ≥ 7 of the 8 present **and holding that relative order** = canon (non-canonical sections interleaved between them do not break the match). **(b) Uniform rhythm** — section-level vertical padding resolves to a single value: `grep -oE 'padding(-block(-start\|-end)?\|-top\|-bottom)?:[^;]*' *.css`, restricted to rules selecting `section`/`.section`/the section wrapper class, then `sort -u` returns exactly 1 distinct value with zero per-section override. **Third signal — escalates (a) alone to FAIL**: the deliverable report / `design-system.md` carries no body-sequence declaration (`grep -c "Body sequence:"` == 0), i.e. the canon was reached by omission instead of picked | Treat the canon or leave it. Set vertical padding section by section, and name the sequence per `design-method/references/body-sequence-bank.md` (its entry 5, "Bookended Canon", exists so the canon can be chosen honestly) — the Selection rule there requires the `Body sequence: {name} — principle applied here: {one line}` line. Reordering one section while keeping one uniform rhythm does **not** clear this: the defect is the uniform treatment, not the order |

**Why entry 15 is a conjunction — measured on `fora`**
(`design-web/references/refs-design/fora-recode/`), the corpus page that follows the
canonical order most closely and still does not read generic. Both conjuncts were run
against it:
- **(a) = false.** Its order is hero → intro → features → what-you-get → pricing → FAQ →
  blog → CTA: 5 of the 8 canonical tokens (no logo wall, no numbered steps, no
  testimonials in any form). Interleaved non-canonical sections do not break a match — the
  canonical ones only need to hold their relative order — but 5 < 7, so the canon test does
  not trip.
- **(b) = false.** `grep -oE 'padding-block:[^;]*' styles.css | sort -u` returns **12**
  distinct values; the section rules alone carry 160px 0 / 180px / 180px 80px / 180px /
  160px 80px / 180px / 180px / 180px 0. Padding is set section by section, exactly what the
  conjunct looks for.

Entry 15 therefore does not fire on `fora`, and its third signal does not fire either — the
page declares its sequence (`body-sequence-bank.md` entry 5, "Bookended Canon"). A detector
that condemned the canonical order alone would fail this page. The order is licensed; the
uniform treatment of it is the defect — which is also why two vertical rules crossing every
section boundary and exactly two gradients marking the opening and the closing are what
`fora`'s own sheet cites as the reason it reads treated.

**What entry 15 is actually aimed at**, stated so the detector is not read as anti-canon:
the page that carries hero → logo wall → 3-4 feature cards → "How it works" 1-2-3 →
testimonials → pricing tiers → FAQ accordion → CTA band, every one of them wrapped in the
same `padding: 96px 0` (or a single `--section-padding` token with no override anywhere),
and whose plan names no sequence because the order was never chosen — it was the default.
That is three independent signals agreeing. `fora` trips none of them.

**Register scope.** Entry 15 is a `brand`-register detector: the canonical token set is a
marketing-page skeleton, so on a `product` deliverable (`design-webapp`) conjunct (a) cannot
match and the entry is inert rather than lenient. The equivalent anti-generic gate for
`product` is the Domain-Specificity Floor
(`design-method/references/register/product.md` §2), run per
`design-review/references/review-procedure.md` Part 2 item 8b.

## Prevention

1. Run `design-method` Step 1 (brief) + Step 2 (signature element) BEFORE any generation —
   not a separate "identity" skill, `design-method` is the single entry point.
2. Generate `design-system.md` with unique OKLCH tokens (`design-system` skill).
3. Gemini Design MCP, Magic, and shadcn MCP are optional tools of convenience — never a
   requirement, and never a substitute for the brief/signature-element discipline above.
4. Run this audit as part of `design-review` Part 1, after every major feature addition.

## Gate Semantics (per entry, no aggregate)

Each entry above is judged **PASS/FAIL independently** — never summed into a score. An
aggregated "X/N flags" number invites self-grading theater and has empirically failed:
cluster #1 (cream/serif/terracotta) shipped through this exact audit while the aggregate
scored low. There is no total to compute.

- Entries 9-11 (cluster co-occurrence): a FAIL is a **FLAG-with-justification**, not a
  BLOCK — a deliberate signature declared per `design-method` Step 2 overrides it.
- All other entries (1-8, 12-15): a FAIL blocks the "audit passed" verdict until fixed.
- Entry 15 is structural: its fix is a different body sequence or a treated one, never a
  cosmetic pass. Same routing as the Lookalike Test in
  `review-procedure.md` Part 2 item 8b.
