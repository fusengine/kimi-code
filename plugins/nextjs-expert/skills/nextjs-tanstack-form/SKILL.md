description: Use when building forms in Next.js 16 with TanStack Form v1 — Server Actions, Zod validation, multi-step wizards, field arrays.
---


<objective>
Implements TanStack Form v1 in Next.js 16 with native Server Actions integration: shared `formOptions` (single source of truth for client and server), Zod schemas for both instant client feedback and `onServerValidate` database checks, `useActionState` for the React 19 form-submission hook, and `mergeForm` to combine server-returned errors with client state.

Covers the Field API (state + handlers), validation timing (onChange/onBlur/onSubmit/onServer), dynamic field arrays and multi-step wizards, debounced async validation, and shadcn/ui field composition. Also documents SOLID file organization for forms (`form-options.ts`, `FormComponent.tsx`, `form.action.ts`) and a comparison against React Hook Form. This is the Next.js Server Actions variant of TanStack Form — for a plain React app without Next.js see the react-forms skill.

# TanStack Form for Next.js 16

Type-safe, performant forms with Server Actions and signal-based reactivity.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze existing forms and validation patterns
2. **research-expert** - Verify latest TanStack Form docs via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - Check form options and field API

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.

## Overview

### When to Use

- Building forms with complex validation requirements
- Need Server Actions integration for form submission
- Implementing multi-step wizards or dynamic field arrays
- Require real-time async validation (username availability)
- Want type-safe forms with full TypeScript inference

### Why TanStack Form

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Signal-based state | Minimal re-renders, optimal performance |
| Full TypeScript | DeepKeys, DeepValue inference |
| Server Actions native | Built-in Next.js 16 integration |
| Zod adapter | Schema-first validation |
| Framework agnostic | Same API for React, Vue, Solid |
| Headless | Works with any UI library (shadcn/ui) |

---

## Critical Rules

1. **formOptions shared** - Define once, use in client and server
2. **Server validation** - DB checks in `onServerValidate`, not client
3. **Zod schemas** - Client-side instant feedback
4. **useActionState** - React 19 hook for Server Actions
5. **mergeForm** - Combine server errors with client state
6. **SOLID paths** - Forms in `modules/[feature]/src/components/forms/`

---

## SOLID Architecture

### Module Structure

Forms organized by feature module:

- `modules/auth/src/components/forms/` - Auth forms (login, signup)
- `modules/auth/src/interfaces/` - Form types and schemas
- `modules/auth/src/actions/` - Server Actions for form submission
- `modules/cores/lib/forms/` - Shared form utilities

### File Organization

| File | Purpose | Max Lines |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `form-options.ts` | Shared formOptions + Zod schema | 50 |
| `FormComponent.tsx` | Client form UI with fields | 80 |
| `form.action.ts` | Server Action with validation | 30 |
| `form.interface.ts` | Types for form values | 30 |

---

## Key Concepts

### Form Options Pattern

Define form configuration once, share between client and server. Ensures type safety and consistency.

### Field API

Each field has state (value, errors, touched, validating) and handlers (handleChange, handleBlur).

### Validation Levels

- **onChange** - Real-time as user types
- **onBlur** - When field loses focus
- **onSubmit** - Before form submission
- **onServer** - Server-side in action

### Error Management

Errors exist at field-level and form-level. Use `field.state.meta.errors` for field errors, `form.state.errorMap` for form errors.

| Client-side form component | [client-form.md](references/client-form.md) — load when wiring `useActionState` + `mergeForm` in a `'use client'` form component |
| Server-side validation | [server-validation.md](references/server-validation.md) — load when writing `createServerValidate` + `ServerValidateError` in a Server Action |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Define schemas first** - Zod schemas drive both validation and types
2. **Shared formOptions** - Single source of truth for client/server
3. **Debounce async validation** - Use `asyncDebounceMs` for API calls
4. **form.Subscribe** - Selective re-renders for submit state
5. **Field composition** - Reusable field components with shadcn/ui
6. **Server errors merge** - Use `mergeForm` to show server validation errors

## Comparison vs React Hook Form

| Aspect | TanStack Form | React Hook Form |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Type Safety | 100% (DeepKeys) | Manual typing |
| Performance | Signals (minimal) | Refs (good) |
| Server Actions | Native support | Manual integration |
| Bundle Size | ~12KB | ~9KB |
| Learning Curve | Medium | Low |
| Use Case | Complex apps | Standard forms |
