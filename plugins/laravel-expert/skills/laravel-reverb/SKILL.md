description: Implement real-time WebSocket communication with Laravel Reverb. Use when adding live updates, chat, notifications, or presence features.
---


<objective>
Covers Laravel Reverb, the first-party WebSocket server, for real-time
features: broadcasting events from server to client, public/private/presence
channel types and authorization, the Echo client-side listener,
ShouldBroadcast queued delivery, and production deployment behind a reverse
proxy with SSL. Use for live notifications, chat/messaging, live dashboards,
and collaborative-editing whisper events — not for background/async work
(that's laravel-queues).
</objective>

# Laravel Reverb

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze existing broadcasting patterns
2. **research-expert** - Verify Reverb docs via Context7
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - Check WebSocket and event patterns

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.

## Overview

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reverb Server** | First-party WebSocket server for Laravel |
| **Broadcasting** | Send events from server to client |
| **Channels** | Public, private, presence scoping |
| **Echo** | Client-side event listener |

---

## Decision Guide

```
Need real-time?
├── Live notifications → Reverb + private channel
├── Chat / messaging → Reverb + presence channel
├── Live dashboard → Reverb + public channel
├── Collaborative editing → Reverb + whisper
└── Background tasks → NOT Reverb (use Queues)
```

---

## Quick Setup

```bash
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

```env
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb
REVERB_APP_ID=my-app
REVERB_APP_KEY=my-key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=my-secret
REVERB_HOST=0.0.0.0
REVERB_PORT=8080
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Use private channels** for authenticated data
2. **Authorize channels** in `routes/channels.php`
3. **Use ShouldBroadcast** for queued delivery (recommended)
4. **Run Reverb behind Nginx/Caddy** in production with SSL

## Reference Guide

| Need | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| Channel types, authorization | [channels.md](references/channels.md) |
| Echo setup, client listeners | [client.md](references/client.md) |

---

## Best Practices

### DO
- Use `ShouldBroadcast` with queue for scalability
- Authorize private and presence channels
- Use presence channels for user awareness

### DON'T
- Broadcast sensitive data on public channels
- Forget to configure CORS for cross-origin clients
- Expose Reverb directly without a reverse proxy

## Laravel 13 Notes

Reverb 1.x (current 1.12) is **Laravel 13 compatible** with no changes. Notes:

- Broadcast events can be routed via `Queue::route(ShouldBroadcast::class, queue: 'events')` (see [[laravel-queues]])
- `Context::add()` is propagated automatically into broadcast events
- PHP: Reverb accepts PHP 8.2+, but Laravel 13 requires PHP 8.3 minimum
- Alternative: first-party **Mercure** driver (13.32+), installable via `php artisan install:broadcasting` (`--pretend` option in 13.33 to preview)
