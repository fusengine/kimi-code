# Laravel Releases

## Overview

Laravel follows semantic versioning with annual major releases. Choose versions based on support timeline and PHP requirements.

## Versioning Scheme

| **Major** (12.0) | Yearly (~Q1) | Yes |
| **Minor** (12.1) | Weekly | No |
| **Patch** (12.0.1) | As needed | No |

**Constraint**: Always use `^12.0` in `composer.json` (not `12.*`).

## Upgrade Decision Guide

```
Current version supported?
├── Yes → Need new features?
│   ├── Yes → Plan upgrade during maintenance window
│   └── No → Stay on current version
└── No (EOL) → Upgrade immediately (security risk)
```

## PHP Compatibility

| Laravel | Minimum PHP | Maximum PHP |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 10 | 8.1 | 8.3 |
| 11 | 8.2 | 8.4 |
