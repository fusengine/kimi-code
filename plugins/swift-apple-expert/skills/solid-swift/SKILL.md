description: Use when applying SOLID principles to Swift 6/SwiftUI code — file-size limits, protocol separation, @Observable, actors, feature-modular architecture.
---


<objective>
Enforces SOLID and DRY principles for Swift 6 and SwiftUI (iOS 26+) projects: a mandatory Features/[Feature]/ modular directory structure (never a flat Sources/ layout), strict file-size limits (100 lines, split at 90, with per-layer budgets for Views/ViewModels/Services/Protocols), protocols separated into their own Protocols/ directories, @Observable + @MainActor for ViewModels, Sendable structs for models, and mandatory #Preview on every View.

Covers all five SOLID principles with dedicated references (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP), concurrency patterns (actors, @MainActor, Sendable), an anti-pattern catalog, and code templates for views, view models, services, protocols, and models.

Requires grepping the codebase for reusable protocols/services before writing new code, and checking shared locations (Core/Extensions/, Core/Utilities/, Core/Protocols/) before duplicating logic used by 2+ features.

# SOLID Swift - Apple Best Practices 2026

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze existing architecture
2. **research-expert** - Verify Swift/Apple docs via Apple Docs MCP + Context7
3. **XcodeBuildMCP** - Build validation after code changes. Then run **sniper**.

---

## DRY - Reuse Before Creating (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY new code:**
1. **Grep the codebase** for similar protocols, services, or logic
2. Check shared locations: `Core/Extensions/`, `Core/Utilities/`, `Core/Protocols/`
3. If similar code exists -> extend/reuse instead of duplicate
4. If code will be used by 2+ features -> create it in `Core/` directly

## Architecture (Features Modular MANDATORY)

| Layer | Location | Max Lines |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Views | `Features/[Feature]/Views/` | 80 |
| ViewModels | `Features/[Feature]/ViewModels/` | 100 |
| Services | `Features/[Feature]/Services/` | 100 |
| Protocols | `Features/[Feature]/Protocols/` | 30 |
| Shared | `Core/{Models,Protocols,Services,Extensions,Utilities}/` | - |

**NEVER use flat `Sources/` structure - always `Features/[Feature]/`**

---

## Critical Rules (MANDATORY)

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| File limit | 100 lines (split at 90) |
| ViewModels | `@MainActor @Observable` |
| Protocols | `Features/[Feature]/Protocols/` or `Core/Protocols/` ONLY |
| Models | `Sendable` structs |
| Documentation | `///` on all public APIs |
| Previews | Every View MUST have `#Preview` |

## Forbidden

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Files > 100 lines | Split at 90 |
| Protocols in impl files | Move to `Protocols/` directory |
| `ObservableObject` | Use `@Observable` |
| Completion handlers | Use `async/await` |
| Missing `#Preview` | Add preview for every View |
| Non-Sendable in async | Use `struct` with `let` |
| Flat `Sources/` structure | Use `Features/[Feature]/` |
