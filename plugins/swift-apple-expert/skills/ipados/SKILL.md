description: Use when building iPad apps — split views, external keyboard support, multitasking, or Stage Manager — adaptive layouts.

<objective>
Covers iPadOS-specific development for tablet and productivity experiences: adaptive layouts across size classes, split views, external keyboard shortcut support, multi-window applications, and Stage Manager / Slide Over multitasking.

Includes the three scene/interaction areas an iPad app typically needs: size-class-aware adaptive layouts, keyboard shortcuts (⌘ commands) for productivity users, and Stage Manager's desktop-like multitasking model.

Best practices: support both compact and regular size classes, add keyboard shortcuts, enable drag and drop, support pointer/trackpad input, allow multiple window instances, and handle external-display output via UIScreen.

# iPadOS Platform

iPadOS-specific development for tablet and productivity experiences.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze existing iPad patterns
2. **research-expert** - Verify latest iPadOS 26 docs via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__apple-docs__search_apple_docs** - Check iPad multitasking patterns

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.
