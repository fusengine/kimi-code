description: Use when preparing an Apple release — code signing, TestFlight upload, App Store submission, or app icons/CI across all platforms.

<objective>
Covers app build, code signing, and distribution across all Apple platforms: certificate/profile management, TestFlight beta distribution, App Store submission, app icon/asset preparation, and StoreKit 2 in-app purchases/subscriptions.

Includes a release checklist (version/build number, app icons for light/dark/tinted, privacy manifest, release configuration, archive validation, TestFlight testing, screenshots, App Store metadata) and guidance on automating releases with fastlane and CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions).

Best practices favor automatic signing, TestFlight testing before any public release, incrementing the build number on every upload, and a mandatory privacy manifest for App Store submission.

# Build & Distribution

App build, signing, and distribution for all Apple platforms.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY distribution, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Check existing build configuration
2. **research-expert** - Verify latest App Store requirements
3. **mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__show_build_settings** - Review build settings

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.

## Overview

### When to Use

- Preparing app for release
- Configuring code signing
- Uploading to TestFlight
- Submitting to App Store
- Creating app icons
- CI/CD pipeline setup

### Why Build Distribution Skill

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Automatic signing | Simplifies certificate management |
| TestFlight | Beta testing with users |
| App Store | Public distribution |
| CI/CD | Automated releases |

## Release Checklist

- [ ] Version and build number updated
- [ ] App icons complete (light/dark/tinted)
- [ ] Privacy manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy)
- [ ] Release configuration
- [ ] Archive validates
- [ ] TestFlight tested
- [ ] Screenshots updated
- [ ] App Store metadata complete

## Best Practices

1. **Automatic signing** - Let Xcode manage
2. **TestFlight first** - Always beta test
3. **Increment build** - Every upload needs new build number
4. **Privacy manifest** - Required for App Store
5. **fastlane** - Automate repetitive tasks
6. **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions for automation
