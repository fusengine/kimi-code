# Fix PR Comments

Systematically address all PR review comments:

   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --comments
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/[PR_NUMBER]/comments

   - **Should Fix**: Code quality, performance, best practices
   - **Nice to Have**: Style preferences, minor suggestions
   - **Questions**: Clarifications needed

3. **Address Each Comment**:
   For each comment:
   - Locate relevant file and line
   - Understand the requested change
   - > Use research-expert if clarification needed on best practices
   - Apply fix following project patterns
   - Mark comment as resolved

4. **Run Quality Checks**:
   > Use sniper to ensure all changes maintain code quality

   ```bash
   bun run lint
   bun test
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   fix: Address PR review comments

   - [Comment 1 fix]
   - [Comment 2 fix]
   - [Comment 3 fix]


   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **Push and Notify**:
