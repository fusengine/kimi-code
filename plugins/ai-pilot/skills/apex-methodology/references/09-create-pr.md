## PR Best Practices

### Size Guidelines

```text
✅ Small PRs (<400 lines changed)
   - Easier to review
   - Faster feedback
   - Lower risk

⚠️ Medium PRs (400-800 lines)
   - Split if possible
   - Detailed description needed

❌ Large PRs (>800 lines)
   - Split into smaller PRs
   - Or use stacked PRs
```

### Review-Friendly PRs

```text
✅ Single logical change
✅ Clear, descriptive title
✅ Thorough description
✅ Linked issues
✅ Test instructions
✅ Screenshots for UI
✅ Self-reviewed
```

---

## After PR Created

### Monitor CI

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view --web

# Check CI runs
gh pr checks

# View CI logs
gh run view [run-id]
```

### Address Review Comments

```text
1. Read all comments first
2. Respond to each:
   - "Done" if fixed
   - "Will address" if need time
   - Discuss if disagree
3. Push fixes
4. Re-request review
```

### Merge Strategies

```text
Merge commit (recommended):
- Preserves all commits
- Release tag stays attached to the bump commit

Squash and merge:
- Single commit in main
- Never use on release branches — squash creates a new SHA and orphans any tag already pointing at the pre-squash bump commit

Rebase and merge:
- Linear history
- No merge commit
```

---

## Merge

### Pre-merge Checklist

```text
□ All CI checks pass
□ Required reviews approved
□ No unresolved comments
□ Branch up-to-date
□ Ready to merge
```

### Merge Command

```bash
# Merge commit (recommended — preserves the release tag's bump commit)
gh pr merge --merge

# With delete branch
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch

gh pr merge --squash   # never on release branches — orphans the tagged bump commit
```

---

## Post-Merge

### Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/branch-name

# Verify merge
git log --oneline -5
```

### Update Related

```text
□ Close related issues
□ Update project board
□ Notify stakeholders
□ Update documentation if needed
□ Monitor production (if deployed)
```

---

## PR Checklist

```text
□ Branch synced with main
□ Conventional PR title
□ Description complete
□ Issues linked
□ Tests documented
□ CI passing
□ Review requested
□ Ready to merge
```

---

## Update Task Phase

At the **start** of this phase, record it (and mark the task `completed` once the PR is opened) in `.kimi/apex/task.json`:

```bash
jq --arg p "create-pr" '.tasks[.current_task].phase = $p' .kimi/apex/task.json \
  > .kimi/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .kimi/apex/task.json.tmp .kimi/apex/task.json
# after the PR is created:
jq '.tasks[.current_task].status = "completed"' .kimi/apex/task.json \
  > .kimi/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .kimi/apex/task.json.tmp .kimi/apex/task.json
```
