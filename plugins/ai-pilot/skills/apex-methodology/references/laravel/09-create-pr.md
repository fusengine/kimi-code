## After PR Created

### Monitor CI

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr status

# View checks
gh pr checks
```

### Respond to Feedback

```text
1. Address all comments
2. Push fixes as new commits
3. Request re-review when ready
4. Don't force-push after review started
```

---

## Merge Strategies

### Merge Commit (Recommended)

```text
- Preserves all commits
- Creates merge commit
- Release tag stays attached to the bump commit
```

### Squash and Merge

```text
- Combines all commits into one
- Never use on release branches — squash creates a new SHA and orphans any tag already pointing at the pre-squash bump commit
```

### Rebase and Merge

```text
- Linear history
- No merge commits
- Clean but loses PR context
```

---

## Post-Merge Tasks

### Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/ISSUE-123-description

# Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete feature/ISSUE-123-description
```

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check production/staging
php artisan about
php artisan migrate:status
```
