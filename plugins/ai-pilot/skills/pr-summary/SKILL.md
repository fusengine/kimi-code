description: Summarize current pull request with diff, comments, and changed files. Use when reviewing PRs or before merging.

<objective>
PR Summary produces a structured overview of the current pull request from `gh pr diff`, `gh pr view --comments`, and `gh pr status`: what the PR does, the key file-level changes, potential risks (breaking changes, security concerns), and what a reviewer should check carefully. It runs in a forked context via the `explore-codebase` agent so the full diff and comment thread don't pollute the parent conversation.
