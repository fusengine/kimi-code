name: exploration
description: Use when exploring an unfamiliar codebase -- architecture analysis, pattern detection, dependency mapping, rapid discovery.
---


<objective>
Exploration runs a 5-phase reconnaissance protocol for rapid codebase discovery: initial reconnaissance (root files, config, entry points), structure mapping, entry-point detection per language, dependency analysis (package.json/pyproject.toml/go.mod/Cargo.toml/composer.json), and architecture-pattern detection (MVC, Clean, Hexagonal, feature-based, layered, modular monolith, Next.js App Router, and more).

It is evidence-based only -- no assumptions without code proof -- and produces a structured report of tech stack, entry points, and detected architecture pattern for whoever consumes it (typically the APEX Analyze phase or a domain expert).

# Exploration Skill

## Exploration Protocol

Run these 5 phases in order — full commands in `references/exploration-protocol.md`:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance** — list root files, find config files, check common entry points
2. **Structure Mapping** — tree view (excluding noise dirs), identify main directories
3. **Entry Points Detection** — grep for `main`/`index`/server bootstrap per language
4. **Dependency Analysis** — read `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`go.mod`/`Cargo.toml`/`composer.json`
5. **Pattern Detection** — check for MVC, Clean/Hexagonal, feature-based, Next.js App Router directories

## Architecture Pattern Detection

### Pattern Indicators

| Pattern | Key Directories | Indicators |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| **MVC** | `controllers/`, `models/`, `views/` | Rails, Laravel, Express |
| **Clean Architecture** | `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/` | DDD, Use cases |
| **Hexagonal** | `adapters/`, `ports/`, `core/` | Ports & adapters |
| **Feature-based** | `features/[name]/` | All layers per feature |
| **Layered** | `presentation/`, `business/`, `data/` | Traditional 3-tier |
| **Monolith** | Single `src/` | Mixed concerns |
| **Microservices** | Multiple `services/` | Separate repos/folders |
| **Next.js App Router** | `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` | Server/Client components |
| **Modular Monolith** | `modules/[name]/` | Bounded contexts |

## Forbidden Behaviors

- ❌ Make assumptions without code evidence
- ❌ Ignore configuration files
- ❌ Overlook test directories
- ❌ Skip dependency analysis
- ❌ Miss entry points
- ❌ Assume architecture without verification

## Behavioral Traits

- Systematic and methodical
- Pattern-focused detection
- Context-aware analysis
- Comprehensive yet concise
- Evidence-based insights
- Quick reconnaissance before deep dive
