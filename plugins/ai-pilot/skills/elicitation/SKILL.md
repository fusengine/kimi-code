name: elicitation
description: Use when an expert agent self-reviews and self-corrects code after the Execute phase, before sniper validation (BMAD-METHOD elicitation techniques).
---


<objective>
Elicitation lets an expert agent self-review and self-correct its own code before external validation, drawing on 75 elicitation techniques across 12 categories (code quality, security, performance, architecture, testing, docs, UX, data, concurrency, integration, observability, maintainability) inspired by BMAD-METHOD. Three modes control how techniques are chosen: MANUAL (default, user picks from 5 presented options), AUTO (auto-detected and applied silently), and SKIP (bypass straight to sniper).

It sits between Execute and eXamine in the APEX flow, scores itself against an exit threshold (>=90% proceed, 70-89% document gaps, <70% iterate), and persists its findings to `.kimi/apex/docs/elicit-{task-slug}.json` so a later pass can diff against prior verdicts instead of restarting.

# Elicitation Skill

## Purpose

Enable expert agents to **self-review and self-correct** their code before external validation (sniper). Based on BMAD-METHOD's 75 elicitation techniques.

---

## 3 Execution Modes

### Mode 1: MANUAL (default)
```
Expert presents 5 relevant techniques → User chooses → Expert applies
```

### Mode 2: AUTO (--auto)
```
Expert auto-detects code type → Auto-selects techniques → Applies silently
```

### Mode 3: SKIP (--skip)
```
Skip elicitation → Go directly to sniper validation
```

---

## Quick Start

**After Execute phase, expert runs:**
```bash
# Manual mode (default)
> Apply elicitation skill

# Auto mode (no prompts)
> Apply elicitation skill --auto

# Skip self-review
> Apply elicitation skill --skip
```

## Auto-Detection Matrix

| Code Type Detected | Auto-Selected Techniques |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Authentication/Security | Security Audit, OWASP Check, Input Validation |
| API Endpoints | Error Handling, Type Coverage, API Contracts |
| Database/ORM | N+1 Detection, Migration Safety, Data Integrity |
| UI Components | Accessibility, Edge Cases, Loading States |
| Business Logic | SOLID Compliance, Unit Test Coverage, Edge Cases |
| Refactoring | Breaking Changes, Regression Analysis, Backward Compat |
| Performance Critical | Profiling, Memory Analysis, Complexity Check |
| Config/Docs/Plugin files (`.md` agents/skills, `hooks.json`, frontmatter YAML) | CQ-01, DOC-01, INT-01 + validation by the **strictest parser in the consumption chain** (e.g. `js-yaml` strict for frontmatter, `json.tool` for JSON) -- never "looks well-formed" |

## Integration with APEX

```
A-nalyze → P-lan → E-xecute → [ELICIT] → X-amine
                       │          │           │
                       ▼          ▼           ▼
                    Expert    Expert       sniper
                     code    self-review   (final)
```

**Benefits:**
- Expert catches own mistakes before sniper
- Faster validation (less sniper corrections)
- Knowledge retention (expert learns from self-review)

---

## Forbidden

- ❌ Skip init step (must load context)
- ❌ Apply techniques without understanding code type
- ❌ Self-correct without documenting changes
- ❌ Report without listing applied techniques
- ❌ Use techniques outside expertise domain

---

## Exit Criteria (Step 5: Report)

**Score** = techniques applied / techniques selected, weighted by critical category (Security, Architecture).

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 90% | 🟢 | Proceed to sniper |
| 70-89% | 🟡 | Document gaps, then proceed |
| < 70% | 🔴 | Iterate before sniper |

**Self-correction failure**: If a self-correction breaks the code → revert that correction and keep the finding as a report item instead.

---

## Artifact Contract

Step 5 persists `.kimi/apex/docs/elicit-{task-slug}.json` so a later pass
diffs against prior verdicts instead of restarting from scratch. Full
contract, `{task-slug}` derivation, and JSON schema: `references/artifact-contract.md`.

## Steps Reference

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | `steps/step-00-init.md` | Load context, detect mode, load prior artifact if present |
| 1 | `steps/step-01-analyze-code.md` | Analyze written code |
| 2 | `steps/step-02-select-techniques.md` | Select techniques |
| 3 | `steps/step-03-apply-review.md` | Apply review |
| 4 | `steps/step-04-self-correct.md` | Self-correct |
| 5 | `steps/step-05-report.md` | Generate report, persist `elicit-{task-slug}.json` |
