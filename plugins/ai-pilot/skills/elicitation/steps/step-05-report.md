# Step 5: Elicitation Report

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 🔴 NEVER skip the report
- ✅ ALWAYS summarize all corrections
- ✅ ALWAYS list deferred issues for sniper
- 🔍 FOCUS on clear handoff to sniper

---

## Context Boundaries

**Input from Step 4:**
- `{corrections_made}`: fixes applied
- `{remaining_issues}`: deferred items
- `{files_modified}`: changed files

**Output:**
- Final report for user
- Handoff context for sniper (Phase X)

---

## YOUR TASK:

### 1. Generate Summary Statistics

```
Calculate:
- Total issues found
- Issues fixed by severity
- Issues deferred
- Files modified
- Techniques applied
```

### 2. Create Handoff for Sniper

```
Sniper needs to know:
- Which files were modified in elicitation
- What issues remain (Low severity)
- What was already verified (skip redundant checks)
```

### 3. Persist the Artifact

Write `.kimi/apex/docs/elicit-{task-slug}.json` -- see `SKILL.md`'s
"Artifact Contract" section for `{task-slug}` derivation. This is what a
later elicitation pass diffs against instead of restarting technique
selection from scratch; the markdown report below is for the human handoff,
this file is for the machine one.

```json
{
  "task_slug": "{task-slug}",
  "generated_at": "{ISO-8601 UTC}",
  "mode": "manual|auto",
  "expert_agent": "{expert_name}",
  "techniques": [
    {
      "technique_id": "SEC-02",
      "verdict": "pass|fail|deferred",
      "correction_applied": true,
      "evidence": "auth.ts:45 -- added isValidEmail() + null check"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- One entry per technique actually applied this pass (Step 3), not per
  technique merely selected.
- `verdict: "pass"` only if Step 3 found no finding, or Step 4 fixed every
  finding for that technique. `"deferred"` for Low-severity items left for
  sniper. `"fail"` if a Critical/High finding could not be corrected.
- On a later pass for the same `{task-slug}`, load this file in Step 0: skip
  re-applying any technique already `"pass"`, re-apply `"fail"`/`"deferred"`
  ones first.

### 4. Generate Final Report

## Report Template

```markdown
## 🟣 Elicitation Report

### Execution Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Mode** | {manual/auto} |
| **Expert Agent** | {expert_name} |
| **Techniques Applied** | {count} |
| **Issues Found** | {count} |
| **Issues Fixed** | {count} |
| **Files Modified** | {count} |

---

### Techniques Applied

| # | Technique | Findings | Status |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | {technique_name} | {count} issues | ✅ Applied |
| 2 | {technique_name} | {count} issues | ✅ Applied |

---

### Issues Fixed (Self-Corrected)

| # | Issue | Severity | File | Fix |
|---|-------|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | {description} | 🔴 | {file} | {fix_summary} |
| 2 | {description} | 🟠 | {file} | {fix_summary} |

---

### Issues Deferred (For Sniper)

| # | Issue | Severity | File | Reason |
|---|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | 🟢 | {file} | Low priority |

---

### Files Modified

```
{file_1} - {change_summary}
{file_2} - {change_summary}
```

---

### Handoff to Sniper (Phase X)

**Already Verified** (skip in sniper):
- [ ] {technique_1} applied
- [ ] {technique_2} applied

**Remaining Checks** (sniper should verify):
- [ ] Linter compliance
- [ ] TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Deferred low-severity issues
- [ ] Integration with rest of codebase

---

### Elicitation Complete

✅ Self-review finished
✅ Critical/High issues addressed
✅ Ready for sniper validation

→ **Proceeding to Phase X: eXamine (sniper)**
```

---

## Success Criteria

Before marking elicitation complete:

- [ ] All Critical issues fixed
- [ ] All High issues fixed
- [ ] Medium issues fixed or justified deferral
- [ ] Low issues documented for sniper
- [ ] Report generated
- [ ] `elicit-{task-slug}.json` written to `.kimi/apex/docs/`
- [ ] Handoff context provided

---

## Transition to Sniper

After this step, the workflow continues to **Phase X (eXamine)** with sniper agent.

Sniper will:
1. Run linters (should find minimal issues)
2. Verify TypeScript/compilation
3. Check deferred low-severity items
4. Final architecture compliance

**Expected**: Sniper finds 0-2 issues if elicitation was thorough.
