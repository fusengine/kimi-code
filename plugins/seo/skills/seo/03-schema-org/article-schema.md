# Article Schema (BlogPosting, NewsArticle)

**JSON-LD structured data for blog posts and news articles (Schema.org 16.0).**

## Why Article Schema Matters

- **Google Rich Results**: Enhanced SERP appearance
- **E-E-A-T Signals**: Author, publisher, dates
- **AI/GEO**: LLMs extract structured data
- **Featured Snippets**: Higher eligibility
