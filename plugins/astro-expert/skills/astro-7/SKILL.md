description: Use when building Astro 7 sites, choosing an output mode (static/server/hybrid), configuring middleware, or upgrading from Astro 5/6.
---


<objective>
Configures and explains Astro 7 (stable, 7.0.9) core framework mechanics: file-based routing, the three output modes (static/server/hybrid) and per-route `prerender`, middleware for auth/redirects/headers, the Vite Environment API, the single Rust compiler (Go compiler removed, strict HTML parsing), stable Content Security Policy, Live Content Collections, and the built-in Fonts API.

Covers initial project setup and migration from Astro 5/6, including breaking changes and Node 22.12+ requirements. Does not cover Content Layer API details (astro-content), Server Actions (astro-actions), Islands hydration directives (astro-islands), UI framework integrations (astro-integrations), or deployment adapters (astro-deployment) — those live in their own skills.

# Astro 7 Expert

Production-ready web framework for content-driven sites with unified dev runtime and Islands Architecture.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze existing routes, layouts, and config
2. **research-expert** - Verify latest Astro 7 docs via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - Check breaking changes v6→v7

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.

## Overview

### When to Use

- Building new content-driven websites or blogs
- Migrating from Astro 6 to version 7
- Configuring static, server, or hybrid output modes
- Setting up middleware for auth or redirects
- Leveraging the new Rust compiler for large sites
- Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Why Astro 7

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Unified Dev Runtime | Dev matches production — fewer "works in dev, breaks in prod" bugs |
| Vite Environment API (Vite 8) | Exact production runtime during development |
| Single Rust Compiler | Go compiler removed — one Rust compiler for `.astro` files, with strict HTML parsing (unclosed tags now error instead of being silently auto-corrected) |
| Live Content Collections | Real-time data from external sources |
| Built-in Fonts API (stable) | Zero-config font loading with performance optimization |
| CSP Support (stable) | Built-in Content Security Policy nonce management |
| Cloudflare Workers | First-class support with workerd runtime in dev |

## Core Concepts

### Output Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `static` (default) | All pages prerendered at build | Blogs, docs, marketing |
| `server` | All pages rendered on demand | Apps, dashboards, auth |
| `hybrid` | Mix static + on-demand | Most production sites |

### Routing

- **File-based routing** — `src/pages/` maps directly to URLs
- **Dynamic routes** — `[slug].astro`, `[...all].astro`
- **Per-route prerender** — `export const prerender = false/true`
- **Endpoints** — `.ts`/`.js` files in `src/pages/` for API routes

## Best Practices

1. **Use `output: 'static'` by default** — Add server only when needed
2. **Per-route `prerender`** — Fine-grained control in hybrid mode
3. **Middleware for cross-cutting concerns** — Auth, redirects, headers
4. **No compiler flag needed** — the Rust compiler is the only compiler now (Go removed); watch for strict HTML parsing errors on unclosed tags
5. **CSP nonces** — Use built-in stable support instead of custom headers
6. **Node 22.12+ required** — odd-numbered Node versions are unsupported; stay on stable TypeScript tooling, the native `tsgo` compiler can make `astro check`/typecheck fail opaquely (see installation.md)
