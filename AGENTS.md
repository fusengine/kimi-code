# AGENTS.md — Fusengine Kimi Code plugin suite (source repo)

Source repository of the 24 Kimi Code plugins deployed to
`~/.kimi-code/plugins/managed/fusengine/`. The GLOBAL Fusengine rules
(identity, non-negotiables, APEX, swarms, SOLID/DRY, tooling) are NOT restated
here: they are installed into `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` from
`plugins/kimi-rules/templates/KIMI.md.template` + the corpus
`plugins/kimi-rules/rules/*.md` merged between the `fusengine:kimi-rules`
fences, and loaded natively every session. Keep this file project-only.

## Layout

- `plugins/` — the 24 plugins (source of truth for manifests, skills, agents)
- `core-overrides/kimi-rules/` — canonical kimi-rules plugin, copied over
  `plugins/kimi-rules/` by `scripts/apply-core-overrides.ts`
- `core-overrides/ai-pilot-agents/` — hand-optimized ai-pilot agents
- `scripts/hooks/kimi-hook-shim.mjs` — THE hook shim source of truth; every
  plugin ships a byte-identical copy in `plugins/*/scripts/`
- `scripts/lib/install/` — installer (`install-kimi.ts` entry)
- `scripts/tests/` — installer e2e tests (Bun test)
- `docs/` — ALL documentation (never outside, except root README.md)

## Commands

- `bun run validate` — manifest/shim/MCP checks, must end `24/24 plugins valid.`
- `bun test scripts/tests/` — installer e2e tests
- `bun run install` — install/update into `$KIMI_CODE_HOME` (dry-run by default)
- `bun run scripts/apply-core-overrides.ts` — re-sync core-overrides → plugins
  (wipes `plugins/kimi-rules`, reinstalls from core-overrides, copies the shim
  into every plugin)

## Repo-specific rules

1. **Shim edits**: edit ONLY `scripts/hooks/kimi-hook-shim.mjs`, then copy it
   into every `plugins/*/scripts/` (the loop in `apply-core-overrides.ts`
   `installShims()`). Never edit a plugin's copy directly.
2. **kimi-rules edits**: edit `core-overrides/kimi-rules/`, then re-run
   `apply-core-overrides.ts`. `plugins/kimi-rules/` is regenerated.
3. **AGENTS.md source chain**: the installer copies
   `plugins/kimi-rules/templates/KIMI.md.template` → `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md`
   and merges the rules corpus between fences (`scripts/lib/install/agents-md.ts`).
   The root `KIMI.template.md` is an identical legacy duplicate of that template.
4. **Hook commands**: every hook in a `kimi.plugin.json` must invoke
   `kimi-hook-shim.mjs` — enforced by `scripts/lib/validate-checks.ts`.
5. **Harness floor**: `package.json` `fusengine.harnessMinVersion` (currently
   0.1.87 — first version with the native UserPromptSubmit rules compaction).
6. **Artifacts in English** (docs, comments, commits, skill/agent files);
   conversation follows the user's language.
7. Validate before declaring done: `bun run validate` + relevant `bun test`.
